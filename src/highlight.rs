//! Full parse + highlight pipeline, executed synchronously in-process.
//!
//! Input: a `session_id` whose primary text has been loaded via
//! [`crate::registry::Registry::set_text`]. Output: either a `Vec` of themed
//! spans (dedup'd, coalesced, UTF-16 offsets) or a fully rendered HTML
//! string. In both cases the pipeline handles language injections
//! recursively, looking injected languages up in the registry by name.
//!
//! The structure mirrors `arborium_highlight::HighlighterCore` upstream,
//! but avoids the async `GrammarProvider` trait — grammar lookups here are
//! just `HashMap` hits, so there's no reason to drag a poll-based wrapper
//! through the runtime. HTML rendering goes through this module's own
//! `tagged_spans_to_html` rather than `arborium_highlight::spans_to_html`:
//! the upstream renderer dedups the *raw* span set internally, which
//! mis-resolves the overlapping captures recursive injection produces at
//! depth >= 2. Rendering from the already-resolved (`dedup_and_tag` +
//! `coalesce_by_tag`) spans instead keeps HTML output lock-step with the
//! themed-span output.

/// `arborium_plugin_runtime::FUEL_PER_OPERATION`) — instead of racing a wall
/// clock. That buys two things a deadline can't:
///
/// - **Determinism.** The same document always costs the same fuel, on any
///   machine. A loaded CPU, a throttled background tab, or a paused
///   debugger can't silently shrink the budget and truncate highlights that
///   would otherwise render fine, and tests can assert on the cutoff.
/// - **A per-document ceiling.** One pool covers every query in the call, so
///   a document is bounded as a whole. Under a per-query budget, a page
///   holding N injected chain-bomb code blocks costs N × the budget; here
///   the first blocks drain the pool and the rest are reported as starved.
///
/// The trade is that fuel bounds work, not seconds — a slower machine takes
/// longer to burn the pool rather than truncating sooner — so the size is a
/// calibration against the slowest host we care about. 80e6 measured at
/// 2–3.5 ms per 1e6 fuel in the browser runtime, i.e. ~200–280 ms of
/// worst-case highlighting, and it leaves ordinary documents untouched:
/// ~750 KB of TypeScript costs ~52e6, and the 16 KB kotlin `a.b().b()…`
/// chain this guard exists for wants ~1.36e9 (17× the pool) so it is cut
